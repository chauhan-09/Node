/*  

Express router is a middleware 
We have a lots of endpoints in a single file server.js
This makes bad experience in code readability as well as code handling
Express Router is a way to modularize and organize your route handling code in an express.js application
So let's create a separate file to manage all the endpoints /person and /menu.
Express router helps you organize and manage these endpoints in your web application. It's like creating separate folders for different types of tasks
