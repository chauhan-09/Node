/* 

Git is a version control system . Saves a particular version of your source code basically saves a snapshot of your code
It is a tool that keeps a record of every version of your code , so you can always go back to a previous state if something goes wrong

why we should not save node_modules folder to github?

1. Huge size 
2. No need to save node modules coz we can just install all the dependencies using package.json file
typing npm i will install all dependencies
