/*

We don't use callback functions anymore we use Async and Await for better code readability and to make our code look less complex

Async and Await are features in JavaScript that make it easier to work with asynchronous code such as network requests,file system operations or database queries.

We use try and catch block

the try block contains the code for creating a new Person document and saving it to the database using await newPerson.save()

if an error occurs during any step it is caught in the catch block and error response is sent with a 500 Interval Server Error status
